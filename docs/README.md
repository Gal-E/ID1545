<div style="color: cadetblue;font-style: italic;">Eg task: “Drive in a circle and use your hands 8 times or less”
The task can become more difficult over time by doing the same thing while going uphill or on a different surface such as grass or sand</div>

- Data collected: Speed on different surfaces, angles
- The data collected can teach us about the behaviour of kids when they use a wheelchair for the first time
- Maybe we can learn about what skills are more challenging for kids to learn when using a wheelchair for the first time
- Possible stakeholders who can benefit from this information: wheelchairs engineers and designers that could improve functionality based on that, doctors and families of kids with wheelchair that can help kids get easily adjusted to the chair etc



#### Progress in Tutorials:

- Still need to finish step 4 in tutorial https://datacentricdesign.github.io/docs/2019/04/30/com-gatt-notify; couldn't do that because the 'things' on the dcd don't work yet.
