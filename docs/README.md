#### Target Users:

- kids age 8-10
- temporary users in hospital
- first timers

#### Goals:

- Gamify simple tasks that involve wheelchair skills
- Encourage kids in wheelchairs to be active and play outside
- Create a community
- Teach basic wheelchair skills

- System: App > User > Physical world > Wheelchair > App
- Optional Sensors: Movement, Acceleration, Touch, Measure the angle 
- Optional Actuators: Speakers, LEDs, vibration

<div style="color: cadetblue;font-style: italic;">Eg task: “Drive in a circle and use your hands 8 times or less”
The task can become more difficult over time by doing the same thing while going uphill or on a different surface such as grass or sand</div>

<div style="margin: 0 auto;text-align: center;"><img src="images/img2.png" style="width: 60%;border: none;box-shadow: none;"/></div>

#### Data:
- Data collected: Speed on different surfaces, angles
- The data collected can teach us about the behaviour of kids when they use a wheelchair for the first time
- Maybe we can learn about what skills are more challenging for kids to learn when using a wheelchair for the first time
- Possible stakeholders who can benefit from this information: wheelchairs engineers and designers that could improve functionality based on that, doctors and families of kids with wheelchair that can help kids get easily adjusted to the chair etc

#### First milestone:
- Create a system that detects when a user has driven a circle.
